# Information Geometry of Nested Frequency Hierarchies

**Why Biological Systems Exhibit High-Dimensional Coherence**

## Overview

Nested frequency hierarchies (theta-gamma coupling, circadian-ultradian rhythms, etc.) are ubiquitous in biology. This paper proves they create high-dimensional phase manifolds:

- K nested frequency bands → (K-1)-dimensional torus
- Inter-band coupling activates off-diagonal Fisher information
- Clock synchronization collapses this to 1 dimension

## Key Results

1. **Product Structure Theorem**: K nested bands create phase manifold T^{K-1}
2. **Coupling Theorem**: Phase-amplitude coupling increases Fisher rank
3. **Clock Collapse Theorem**: Global synchronization reduces Fisher rank to ≤1

## Status

- **Target**: Information Geometry
- **Status**: Draft complete
- **Depends on**: Hold until AISM coupled-rank paper resolves
- **If AISM accepts**: Strip coupling content, cite AISM paper
- **If AISM rejects**: Submit as-is (merged version)

## Key Equation

Fisher rank gap: biological (≥K-1) vs clocked (≤1)

For neural systems with 4-6 frequency bands, this is a 3-5 dimensional gap.

## Connection to Research Program

- Provides geometric foundation for claims in Intelligence paper (BioSystems 2026)
- Explains *where* high-D coherence comes from (nested frequencies)
- Explains *why* digital substrates can't match it (clock collapse)
